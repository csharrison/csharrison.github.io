Hello! My name is Charlie Harrison. I'm a software engineer at Google working on Chrome and the web platform.
Lately, I've been focused on methods to make online advertising more private through the [Privacy Sandbox](https://privacysandbox.com/) initiative.

I expect to write about topics I'm learning about, which these days are usually privacy related.
